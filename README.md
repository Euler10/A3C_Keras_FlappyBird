# A3C_Keras_FlappyBird
This repository uses Asynchronous advantage actor-critic algorithm (A3C) to play Flappy Bird using Keras. The details of this algorithm are mentioned in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf) by Deep Mind.

# Installation Dependencies
* Python 3.5
* Keras 2.0
* pygame 
* scikit-image
